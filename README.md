# City Planner.
City Planner is a cross-platform mobile application written in Dart, using the Flutter framework.

The application’s purpose is to provide solutions that can aid users when travelling to new cities worldwide. By splitting places of interest into 5 subcategories; restaurants/food, nightlife/bars, entertainment/activities, sightseeing/landmarks and shopping, users can easily identify which point of interest may be of interest to them.

With use of Google Places API and Google maps, the application recommends POIs to users. Location based services allow the application to provide results using a radius around the user’s location, and then ranking them in order of prominence.
